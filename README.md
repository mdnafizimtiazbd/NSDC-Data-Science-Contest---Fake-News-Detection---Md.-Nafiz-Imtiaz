# NSDC-Data-Science-Contest---Fake-News-Detection---Md.-Nafiz-Imtiaz
This contest was done with a collaboration with NSDC, Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub) and herWILL. I have participated in the contest after a 3 day long workshop named "The Data Forge: Workshop & Contest". I've learned Decoding data, introduction to NLP preprocessing and Classification using Supervised Learning.
